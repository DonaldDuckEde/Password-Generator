# Technical Documentation: **The EasyPass Function**

The EasyPass function is a Python function that generates a random password of a specified length, with options to include uppercase letters and digits. The function takes three arguments:

* **length:** an integer that specifies the length of the password to be generated.
* **upper:** a boolean that specifies whether to include uppercase letters in the password (default is False).
* **digits:** a boolean that specifies whether to include digits in the password (default is False).

The function uses the random module and the string module to generate a password consisting of randomly chosen characters from a set of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits. The password is then returned as a string.

```python
>>> generatepassword(8, True, True)
'Fh6aTcD8'

>>> generatepassword(10, False, True)
'9v2j5s7p0r'

>>> generatepassword(12)
'flxuGq3rEkTd'

```

In the first example, a password of length 8 with uppercase letters and digits is generated. In the second example, a password of length 10 with digits only is generated. In the third example, a password of length 12 with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits is generated.

## Possible Improvements

The **EasyPass** function could be improved by adding additional options for including other types of characters in the password, such as symbols or special characters. Additionally, the function could be modified to ensure that the generated password contains at least one of each type of character (lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, etc.) to increase the strength of the password.
